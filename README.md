# Kit Language TextMate Bundle

This is a very simple bundle I created for editing [Kit files][KIT] in
[TextMate 2][TM2]. There's a couple of snippets for *includes* and *variables,*
and a language file to enable syntax highlighting (piggybacking on the already
exisiting HTML bundle).

By all means, use the [Issue Tracker][ISSUES] if you have any, erm... *issues* :-)
